# What is the Auto Valuer?

Auto-valuation is a program for the Truman Besief Program that takes financial statements for a company from Morningstar and valuates the information to recieve financial information (debt, profit, etc) about certain companies such as AAPL and MSFT.

# How does it work?

Its a python built program that writes date into excel sheets. It uses chromedriver to access Chrome and travel to Morningstar.com to download the financial sheets. If chromedriver fails then the user must manually place the sheets into the program to evaulate.
