DDM is complete; But the GUI needs an additional input for years of high growth specifically for 
DDM.

Multiples isn't even close to being done. But we may have come close.

If we can webscrape the morningstar website to grab valuation ratios, we could possibly do a multiples
valuation. But this will be difficult.

We need to pull:
Forward P/E
P/B
P/S
P/CF

Enterprise Value can either be calculated or pulled, if yfinance allows for it, we can pull it from there.
EBITDA is found on income statement, so we are fine.

Most likely once Rupak fixes DDM we will move to testing phase and worry about multiples later.
Multiples is far less time consuming than DCF.
